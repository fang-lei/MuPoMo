Published in :      MuPoMo (Mortality Model for Multip-populations: A Semiparametric Comparison Approach)

Description :      'Estimates and forecasts mortality rates based on a semi-parametric approach, which applies parametric modelling for 
                    multiple nonparametric smoothed curves with the shape-related nonlinear variation.’

Keywords :         ‘time series, demography, mortality, population, nonparametric smoothing, parametric modelling, Lee-Carter method’
