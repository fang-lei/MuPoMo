Description :      'Estimates and forecasts mortality rates based on a semi-parametric approach, which applies 
                    parametric modelling for multiple nonparametric curves with the shape-related nonlinear variation. 
                    Uses random two countries to demonstrate two-country case.'

Keywords :         'time series, demography, mortality, population, nonparametric smoothing, parametric modelling, 
                    Lee-Carter method, contour'
